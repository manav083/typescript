1. Typescript is the superset of javascript that adds static typing
and other features to enhance javascript development. It was devoloped
by Microsoft on Oct 1, 2012, and is now an open-source project with a
large community of contributors.

2. It is easier to read, write and maintain than javascript.

3. Any valid javascript code is also valid Typesript code.

Advantages of TypeScript : 

1. let fname = 'vinod
    fname = 105
    fname = true
    console.log(fname); // true (In javascript)

2. let fname:string = 'vinod'  // explictly defined string
        fname = 105 
        fname = true
        console.log(fname) // error not valid in typescript

/// In Typescript ///
3. let fname = 'vinod'   // Type Inference
    fname = 105
    fname = true
    console.log(fname); // error 

4. It gives you error and warning while writing the code not like
javascript which gives error after compiling the code.(Easier to write)

5. it has more features like Classes, enums, tuples etc.

6. Typescript catches error at compile time instead of runtime,
which makes debugging easier and reduces of likelihood of bugs
in production.

/// Disadvantages ///

1. Browser can't understand typescript. At last it has to be compiled into
javascript which browser understands.




/// TS Configuration file: ///

We need this file to config our code like if want ts compiler 
to not create js file if our ts file has error then we can config
inside this file.
